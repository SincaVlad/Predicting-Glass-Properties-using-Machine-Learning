The standard enthalpy of formation is a fundamental thermodynamic property that determines its phase stability, which can be coupled with other thermodynamic data to calculate phase diagrams. Calorimetry provides the only direct method by which the standard enthalpy of formation is experimentally measured. However, the measurement is often a time and energy intensive process. We present a dataset of enthalpies of formation measured by high-temperature calorimetry. The phases measured in this dataset include intermetallic compounds with transition metal and rare-earth elements, metal borides, metal carbides, and metallic silicides. These measurements were collected from over 50 years of calorimetric experiments. The dataset contains 1,276 entries on experimental enthalpy of formation values and structural information. Most of the entries are for binary compounds but ternary and quaternary compounds are being added as they become available. The dataset also contains predictions of enthalpy of formation from first-principles calculations for comparison.}, publisher={figshare}, author={Kim, George and Meschel, Susan and Nash, Philip and Chen, Wei}, year={2017}, month={Oct}}']

Dataset: expt_formation_enthalpy_kingsbury
Description: Dataset containing experimental standard formation enthalpies for solids. Formation enthalpies were compiled primarily from Kim et al., Kubaschewski, and the NIST JANAF tables (see references). Elements, liquids, and gases were excluded. Data were deduplicated such that each material is associated with a single formation enthalpy value. Refer to Wang et al. (see references) for a complete desciption of the methods used. Materials Project database IDs (mp-ids) were assigned to materials from among computed materials in the Materials Project database (version 2021.03.22) that were 1) not marked 'theoretical', 2) had structures matching at least one ICSD material, and 3) were within 200 meV of the DFT-computed stable energy hull (e_above_hull < 0.2 eV). Among these candidates, we chose the mp-id with the lowest e_above_hull that matched the reported spacegroup (where available).
Columns:
	formula: Chemical formula.
	expt_form_e: Experimental standard formation enthalpy (298 K), in eV/atom.
	uncertainty: Uncertainty reported in the experimental formation energy, in eV/atom.
	phaseinfo: Description of the material's crystal structure or space group.
	reference: Reference to the original data source.

Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a material's composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark. We also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm---namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given {\\textasciitilde}104 or greater data points.

We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method{\\textendash}dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method{\\textendash}sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path{\\textendash}dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},\nURL = {http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/4/eaaq1566},\neprint = {http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/4/eaaq1566.full.pdf},\njournal = {Science Advances}\n}']

We have predicted at least 1356 such 2D materials. For all the systems satisfying our criterion, we manually create single layer systems and calculate their energetics, structural, electronic, and elastic properties for both the bulk and the single layer cases. Currently the database consists of 1012 bulk and 430 single layer materials, of which 371 systems are common to bulk and single layer. The rest of calculations are underway. To validate our criterion, we calculated the exfoliation energy of the suggested layered materials, and we found that in 88.9% of the cases the currently accepted criterion for exfoliation was satisfied. Also, using molybdenum telluride as a test case, we performed X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering experiments to benchmark our calculations and understand their applicability and limitations.

Specifically, if the relative difference between the two lattice constants for a specific material is greater than or equal to 5%, we predict them to be good candidates for 2D materials. We have predicted at least 1356 such 2D materials. For all the systems satisfying our criterion, we manually create single layer systems and calculate their energetics, structural, electronic, and elastic properties for both the bulk and the single layer cases. Currently the database consists of 1012 bulk and 430 single layer materials, of which 371 systems are common to bulk and single layer. The rest of calculations are underway. To validate our criterion, we calculated the exfoliation energy of the suggested layered materials, and we found that in 88.9% of the cases the currently accepted criterion for exfoliation was satisfied. Also, using molybdenum telluride as a test case, we performed X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering experiments to benchmark our calculations and understand their applicability and limitations.

Dataset: ricci_boltztrap_mp_tabular
Description: Ab-initio electronic transport database for inorganic materials. Complex multivariable BoltzTraP simulation data is condensed down into tabular form of two main motifs: average eigenvalues at set moderate carrier concentrations and temperatures, and optimal values among all carrier concentrations and temperatures within certain ranges. Here are reported the average of the eigenvalues of conductivity effective mass (mₑᶜᵒⁿᵈ), the Seebeck coefficient (S), the conductivity (σ), the electronic thermal conductivity (κₑ), and the Power Factor (PF) at a doping level of 10¹⁸ cm⁻³ and at a temperature of 300 K for n- and p-type. Also, the maximum values for S, σ, PF, and the minimum value for κₑ chosen among the temperatures [100, 1300] K, the doping levels [10¹⁶, 10²¹] cm⁻³, and doping types are reported. The properties that depend on the relaxation time are reported divided by the constant value 10⁻¹⁴.

Due to their remarkable stability with respect to cation substitution, new compounds for such applications potentially await discovery. In this work, we present an exhaustive dataset of formation energies of 5,329 cubic and distorted perovskites that were calculated using first-principles density functional theory. In addition to formation energies, several additional properties such as oxidation states, band gap, oxygen vacancy formation energy, and thermodynamic stability with respect to all phases in the Open Quantum Materials Database are also made publicly available. This large dataset for this ubiquitous crystal structure type contains 395 perovskites that are predicted to be thermodynamically stable, of which many have not yet been experimentally reported, and therefore represent theoretical predictions. The dataset thus opens avenues for future use, including materials discovery in many research-active areas.}, publisher={figshare}, author={Emery, Antoine}, year={2017}, month={Aug}}']
