# Predicting Glass Transition Temperature Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and data used in my dissertation on predicting the glass transition temperature (Tg) of glass materials using various machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and optimization, as well as the evaluation of model performance.

## Overview

In this project, I utilized a dataset of approximately 29,000 glass compositions, derived from the SciGlass database, to predict the glass transition temperature (Tg) using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression. The best-performing model was optimized and evaluated using various metrics, with results indicating significant potential for the application of machine learning in materials science.
