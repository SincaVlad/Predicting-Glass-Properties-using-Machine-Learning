# Disertation


Machine learning is turning things(data) [images, text, tabels of numbers, video, audio, etc] into numbers and finding patterns in those numbers.

Finding patterns is the computer (algorithm) job

Algorithm = code that executes math

AI(ML(DL))


Noraml programming:

Inputs + Rules = Output

ML Programming:

Supervised learning (figure out the relationship between input/output)
Inputs + Outputs = Rules

ML Scope is to find out the rules (relationship betewwwn input/output)

ML good for structured data!

Great Algorithm for ML(strucured data) -> Gradient Boosted Machine (XGBoost)

Turning patterns into numbers


Types of ML Algoriths best suited for strucured data:
- Random Forrest etc
