# Predicting Glass Properties using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the properties of glass using various machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset containing glass compositions and their corresponding transition temperatures (Tg), aiming to develop predictive models through a series of Python scripts.

## Overview

In this project, I utilized a dataset of approximately 29,000 glass compositions, derived from the SciGlass database, to predict the glass transition temperature (Tg) using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression. The best-performing model was optimized and evaluated using various metrics, with results indicating significant potential for the application of machine learning in materials science.
