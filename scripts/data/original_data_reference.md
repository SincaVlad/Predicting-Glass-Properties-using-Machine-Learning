# Original Data Reference

This project utilizes data from the SciGlass database to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the properties of glass. SciGlass is a comprehensive database that contains information about the composition and properties of various glass materials. The data used in this project primarily focuses on the oxide compositions of glass and their respective glass transition temperatures (Tg).
